The program showcases binarization, a datapreprocessing technique which, given a certain threshold, 
assign an extreme value (0 or 255 in the context of pixel colour) to a variable. In the main.py I:
1) convert the image to grayscale
2) transform the 2D picture into a 1D array
3) convert each pixel to either 0 (black) or 1(white) based on a threshold of 0.5 (adjustable for
   testing out different possibilities.
4) print and show the images
